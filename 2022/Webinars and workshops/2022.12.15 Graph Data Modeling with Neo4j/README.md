# Welcome

Today's workshop was a privately held Zoom call led by Tom Geudens.

## Pre-workshop email

```
Good morning,

You have registered for the Neo4j Lightning Modeling session that starts in approximately six hours (at 13h00 Central European Time).

The group is - once more - going to be big (which is great), so a couple of points:

- Zoom link: https://neo4j.zoom.us/j/98982792560?pwd=dGU4MEV0aEtJWXIxOVJwc1JCeWIvUT09
- Sli.Do link (for your questions during the session): https://app.sli.do/event/saivcyhNAdL6ygEC3tyAoV
- Please mute yourself and use chat to answer my questions
- If you want the materials afterwards, give me some way to link your attendance to your registration (by changing your Zoom name to the email you used for registering or to an attendeeXXX if you got one for the Basics training, ...). I want to reward those that actually attend. Thank you!

I'm looking forward to it!
Tom Geudens
Neo4j EMEA Field Team
