# Welcome

This section contains my thoughts from the `Training Series - Getting started with Neo4j Bloom` webinar presented at 7am PST on Wednesday, March 9th, 2022.

## Getting started

The essential piece for the hands-on workshop is to make sure that you have created a free account in [Neo4j Aura](https://console.neo4j.io) that creates a database on the free tier using the example Movies dataset.

I've created a `.env.sample` file for reference. Please copy that to `.env` and then you can safely store your credentials without sharing them accidentally with the world on GitHub 🤓

## Overview

What is Bloom? Think of Bloom as a purpose-built visualization tool. There are quite a few unique features: Low code visualization, layouts, advanced rules-based styling and filtering, custom search phrases, scene sharing, etc.
