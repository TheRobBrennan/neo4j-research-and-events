# Welcome

This section contains my thoughts from the `Training Series - Intro to Neo4j` webinar presented at 7am PST on Wednesday, March 2nd, 2022.

## Getting started

The first part of this webinar covered an excellent overview of some example graphs and use cases.

Let's take a look at an example that processes a bunch of documents and files to generate a graph to investigate the Paradise Papers by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ):

The essential piece for the hands-on workshop is to make sure that you have created a free account in [Neo4j Aura](https://console.neo4j.io) that creates a database on the free tier using the example Movies dataset.

I've created a `.env.sample` file for reference. Please copy that to `.env` and then you can safely store your credentials without sharing them accidentally with the world on GitHub ðŸ¤“

## Identifying good graph scenarios

## Property graph database

## Querying the graph

Quick reference - you can find the latest Neo4j reference card for Cypher at [http://dev.neo4j.com/refcard](http://dev.neo4j.com/refcard)

## Use the Aura Movies database you created

Connect to your database using Neo4j Browser and start querying. ðŸ¤“

Example query
![screenshots/20220302-09-example-query.png](screenshots/20220302-09-example-query.png)

Visualize the graph database schema

Zoom out to view results from the query

### Queries

Find all nodes with a `Movie` label
![screenshots/20220302-12-query-for-movie-labels.png](screenshots/20220302-12-query-for-movie-labels.png)

Table view
![screenshots/20220302-13-table-view-for-results.png](screenshots/20220302-13-table-view-for-results.png)

Query for movie title and release year
![screenshots/20220302-14-query-for-movie-title-and-release-year.png](screenshots/20220302-14-query-for-movie-title-and-release-year.png)

Query all `Movie` and `Person` nodes - no relationship
![screenshots/20220302-15-query-for-movies-and-people-no-relationship.png](screenshots/20220302-15-query-for-movies-and-people-no-relationship.png)

Display nodes with any relationship between a `Person` and a `Movie`
![screenshots/20220302-16-query-for-person-nodes-with-any-relationship-to-a-movie.png](screenshots/20220302-16-query-for-person-nodes-with-any-relationship-to-a-movie.png)

Let's find all the people that have `ACTED_IN` a `Movie`
![screenshots/20220302-18-query-for-person-nodes-with-an-ACTED_IN-relationship-to-a-movie.png](screenshots/20220302-18-query-for-person-nodes-with-an-ACTED_IN-relationship-to-a-movie.png)

What about building upon the previous query to find all the people who acted in those same movies AND the other actors? Easy.
![screenshots/20220302-20-query-for-people-who-have-acted-in-movies-along-with-the-other-actors-and-movies-other-actors-were-in.png](screenshots/20220302-20-query-for-people-who-have-acted-in-movies-along-with-the-other-actors-and-movies-other-actors-were-in.png)

Query for specific actors
![screenshots/20220302-21-query-for-keanu-reeves.png](screenshots/20220302-21-query-for-keanu-reeves.png)
![screenshots/20220302-22-query-for-tom-hanks.png](screenshots/20220302-22-query-for-tom-hanks.png)
![screenshots/20220302-23-query-for-tom-hanks-using-a-where-clause.png](screenshots/20220302-23-query-for-tom-hanks-using-a-where-clause.png)

Let's have fun with the movies Tom Hanks `ACTED_IN` and return some results.

What about finding the top 3 people in our movies dataset?

### What about deleting records that match a pattern?

### Creating data and relationships

Cypher does offer a `CREATE` statement that will create data and relationships. However, it will constantly create and recreate to your heart's content. Use `MERGE` to upsert data instead.

![screenshots/20220302-39-create-a-node-only-once.png](screenshots/20220302-39-create-a-node-only-once.png)

Find a specific person and movie that we want to create a relationship between

## Web-based Data Importer tool from Neo4j

This is a great tool available at [https://data-importer.neo4j.io](https://data-importer.neo4j.io)

## EXAMPLE: Import Stack Overflow data into Neo4j

Let's see how we can use Neo4j to import and explore some data from Stack Overflow.
